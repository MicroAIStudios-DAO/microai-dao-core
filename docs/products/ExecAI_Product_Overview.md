## Overview

ExecAI is the flagship SaaS product of MicroAI Studios. It is designed to serve as an AI-powered copilot for founders, executives, and leadership teams, providing data-driven insights, risk analysis, and decision support. ExecAI is built on top of the MicroAI Governance Engine and leverages the Ethical Profitability Index (EPI) to ensure that all recommendations are aligned with both financial and ethical objectives.

## Key Features

*   **Risk Analysis:** ExecAI provides in-depth risk analysis for strategic and financial decisions, helping leadership teams identify potential pitfalls and mitigate risks.

*   **Transparent Decision Logging:** All interactions with ExecAI are logged and can be audited, providing a complete record of the decision-making process.
*   **On-Chain Voting (ExecAI Voter):** For organizations using the MicroAI governance stack, ExecAI can participate in on-chain voting as a formal stakeholder, with a configurable voting power.

*   **AI C-Suite Agents:** A suite of specialized AI agents, including a CEO-AI for strategic planning and a CFO-AI for financial analysis.
