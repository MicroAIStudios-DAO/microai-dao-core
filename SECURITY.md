# Security Policy


## Reporting a Vulnerability


The MicroAI Studios team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.


To report a security issue, please email [security@microaistudios.com](mailto:security@microaistudios.com) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line. We will work with you to assess and understand the scope of the issue and to fully address any valid vulnerabilities. All security reports will be promptly investigated and addressed by our team.


## Scope


If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, we encourage you to report it to us as soon as possible. This policy applies to all repositories under the MicroAI Studios organization on GitHub.


## Responsible Disclosure


We ask that you follow responsible disclosure practices and not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it. We will do our best to respond to your report within 24 hours and to keep you informed of our progress.


We are grateful for your help in keeping MicroAI Studios and our users safe.
